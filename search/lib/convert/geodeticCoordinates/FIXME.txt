This directory contains code from the Harmony project that should be integrated into 
CMR-STAC at some point in the future. It was translated from TypeScript, but some 
of the TypeScript-specific code was left in as comments for reference. 

The point of the files in this directory was to map cartesian coordinates to geodetic
coordinates when converting polygons to bounding boxes in the cmrSpatialToStacBbox() 
function in search/lib/convert/granules.js. The idea is that the farther towards the 
poles that a polygon reaches, the more of a possibility there is for the upper limit of
a bounding box encompassing a polygon to bow towards the pole.
